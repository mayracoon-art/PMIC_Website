I am an analog and mixed-signal IC design engineer with research interests spanning **analog front-end circuits, data converters, and power management ICs**.

My work focuses on bridging **circuit-level innovation** with **practical system applications**, particularly in sensing, biomedical, and low-power electronic systems.
